# RunAlert Application Overview

## Purpose
RunAlert is a real-time communication and safety platform designed specifically for race events, providing critical information and alerts to runners, race officials, and event administrators. The platform consists of two web applications: RunAlert (for participants and officials) and RunAlertAdmin (for race administrators).

## Core Value Proposition
RunAlert addresses the safety and communication challenges in race events by:

- **Enhancing Runner Safety**: Delivering real-time alerts about course conditions, weather changes, or emergencies directly to participants.
- **Streamlining Communication**: Creating a unified communication channel between race administrators, officials, and participants.
- **Improving Event Management**: Providing administrators with tools to monitor race progress and respond quickly to developing situations.
- **Supporting Decision Making**: Offering real-time insights about runner positions, checkpoint statuses, and course conditions to help administrators make informed decisions.

## Key Differentiators
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Push notifications delivered instantly to all stakeholders or targeted groups.
- **Location-Aware Messaging**: Geo-fenced alerts that trigger when runners enter specific areas.
- **Dual Interface System**: Separate applications for participants/officials and administrators with appropriate features for each user type.
- **Safety-First Design**: Focus on reliability and accessibility of critical information during race events.

## Current Development State
The application is in active development with core messaging features implemented and ongoing work to refine the user interface and enhance functionality. The current focus is on polishing the messaging UI and ensuring a consistent user experience across the application.
